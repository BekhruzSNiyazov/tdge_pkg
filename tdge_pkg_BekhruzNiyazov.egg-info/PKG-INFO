Description: # 3D Game Engine (TDGE)
        
        TDGE is a Python library for creating 3D Games. **It is still in development**.
        
        ## Installation
        
        You will be able to install this library using **pip** later. This code is still in development.
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        # importing the library
        import tdge
        
        # creating a game surface
        game = tdge.Game(movement=True, width=8, height=8, title="Hello, test")
        # you can disable movement of the player by calling the disable_movement() method
        game.disable_movement()
         # you can enable movement of the player by calling the enable_movement() method
        game.enable_movement()
        
        # you can set the background of the game using set_background() method
        # if you don't want to make the window resizable, set resizable to False, or just skip this argument
        # background_type can be an image or a color
        # if you want to set a background as an image
        # you need to provide image_path argument to the path of image like that:
        tdge.display.set_background(game, background_type="image", image_path="the_path_image", resizable=True)
        # alternatively, you can fill the background with color like that:
        tdge.display.set_background(game, background_type="color", color=(255, 255, 255), resizable=True)
        # you can draw a cube by calling the draw_cube method()
        tdge.display.draw_cube(game, size=(1, 1, 1), coords=(1, 1, 1), color=(0, 0, 255))
        # to start the game you need to call the start_game() method
        tdge.start_game(game)
        ```
        If you want to add some code developed using pygame you can do that easily.
        Just put all pygame code in a function and when you call the start_game() method you need to pass that function as a argument to pygame_code. Here is an example:
        ```python
        def code_in_pygame():
            pygame.draw.rect(game.win, (0, 0, 0), (100, 100, 10, 10)) # replace "game" with whatever you assigned the Game object to
            pygame.display.update()
            
        tdge.start_game(game, pygame_code=code_in_pygame) # you don't need need brackets after passing code_in_pygame function as an argument to pygame_code
        ```
